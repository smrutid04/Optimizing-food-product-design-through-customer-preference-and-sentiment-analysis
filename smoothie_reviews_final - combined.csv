India,Very nice product. Easy to make. Healthy and tasty. When additional fruit pulp is added it becomes more tasty. Value for money as healthy and easily making product is available for this price. Alternative to traditional morning drinks.,Berries
India,"My rating would be -
Berry>Orange>chocolate>iced coffee
Berry just tastes divine.
Orange is good too
Chocolate - I can drink but won't buy again
Iced coffee - can't drink, won't drink (tastes weird)

Next time I think I'll just buy the ones which have Berry flavour instead of the assorted one.

My only qualm is that it's not as filling. For me it was almost the same as drinking flavoured, viscous water.",Berries
India,"I found them on Instagram and had a chat but I was very scared because they will ship from Maharashtra, the Covid den. But I took a chance and ordered and WOW...My breakfast problem is sorted forever. All the flavours are awesome.

India,"Love smoothies. They're great substitutes for a healthy meal. However, struggled a lot for smoothies without added sugars. I'm glad I found smartobite! Started with Berries and basil!

Received my package within 3days and we'll packed笍",Berries
India,"Great taste and flavours. Quite filling. I blended it with a banana, was full for hours. Very affordable price too.",Berries
India,"The smoothies are ready to use, simple to mix, yummy & satiating (keeps you full for couple of hours). I sometimes simply mix with milk using a spoon (when in a hurry) though then I have to eat the rest over dried oats. I like the product though not entirely sure of its nutritive value as some preservative is still there. Also it claims to be sugar free but appears to be mildly sweetened.",Berries

India,"Because of added calcium and various vitamins the taste of this Hershey's strawberry milkshake has what you would find in paracetamol. Yes, it has that intense medicine flavor. The strawberry taste is lost in between the fortified nutrient addition. Milk is good and rich, but so is plain milk from your trusted dairy. I had somewhat high hopes because of the brand Hershey's, and also because I have had a delicious experience with similarly fortified milkshakes by Britannia and Mother Dairy. This one has a parallel opposite taste compared to them. Better to use NestlÃ© milkshake powder that comes in various flavors including strawberry, vanilla and banana, use quality milk and a scoop of your preferred ice cream and blend it at home. That will be a true milkshake with delicious taste.",Banana
India,Nice,Banana
India,Favourite of the kids. For quick home work done... a nice treat,Banana
